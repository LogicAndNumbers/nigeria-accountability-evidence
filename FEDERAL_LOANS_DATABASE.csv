### NOTES ON DATABASE:
# 1. All amounts in USD unless specified otherwise
# 2. NGN amounts calculated at approximate exchange rates at time of signing
# 3. Benchmark costs based on World Bank, AfDB, and comparable international projects
# 4. Cost Variance % = ((Actual Cost - Benchmark Cost) / Benchmark Cost) * 100
# 5. Red Flags column captures major accountability concerns
# 6. FOI Request Status: Not Requested / Partial / Active / Denied / Responded
# 7. Sources cited are abbreviated; full citations in Master Document
# 8. This is Version 1.0 - requires continuous updates as new information emerges

### KEY FINDINGS FROM DATABASE:
# - Total documented loans: ~$25 billion (2000-2025)
# - Estimated overcharges: $7-10 billion (28-40% of total)
# - Chinese loans dominate infrastructure: $13+ billion
# - World Bank: $2.1+ billion with mixed results
# - Eurobonds: $14 billion with zero project-level transparency
# - French bilateral: €600M+ ($650M+) with limited disclosure

# 4. Cross-check contractor names with CAC Beneficial Ownership Register
# 5. Track contractor executives' asset declarations
# 6. Correlate loan signatures with property acquisitions (see PEP tracker)
# 7. Support civil society lawsuits for disclosure
# 8. Make this data viral - every Nigerian should see these numbers
