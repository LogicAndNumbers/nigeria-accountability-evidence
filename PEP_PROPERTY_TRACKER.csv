### NOTES ON PEP TRACKER:
# 1. Names withheld for active investigations to avoid legal issues; full names available via cited sources
# 2. Wealth Variance = Property Value - Total Legitimate Govt Salary for Period
# 3. Official salaries based on public service pay scales (Ministers: ~₦2M/month, Senators: ~₦1M/month as of 2020)
# 4. Dubai Unlocked: Major 2024 leak of Dubai Land Dept records
# 5. Pandora Papers: 2021 ICIJ investigation of offshore structures
# 6. Carnegie/OCCRP: Independent investigative research
# 7. Some entries are categorical summaries due to volume of individuals

### KEY FINDINGS:
# - 1,600+ properties worth $1+ billion linked to 200+ Nigerian PEPs in Dubai alone
# - Average property value far exceeds lifetime government salaries
# - Purchases often cluster around major contract awards or revenue collection periods
# - Offshore companies and shell structures used to obscure ownership
# - Dubai remains preferred destination (lax AML enforcement until recently)
# - London properties via Land Registry show similar patterns
# - Swiss bank accounts suspected but less documented (banking secrecy)

### CRITICAL PATTERNS:
# 1. NNPC officials during subsidy era (2015-2023) → Dubai properties
# 2. State revenue officials during Alpha Beta period → Dubai properties  
# 3. Ministers who signed Chinese loan contracts → Properties acquired shortly after
# 4. Contractors who received inflated contracts → Massive property portfolios
# 5. Timing: Property purchases spike during tenures, not before or long after

### EVIDENCE HIERARCHY:
# Tier 1: Public land registries (Dubai DLD, UK Land Registry) - Verifiable
# Tier 2: International investigations (ICIJ, OCCRP, Carnegie) - Credible
# Tier 3: Nigerian investigative journalism (Premium Times, ICIR) - Reliable
# Tier 4: Whistleblower reports - Requires corroboration

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Cross-reference PEP names with Federal Loans Database (who signed contracts?)
# 2. Check purchase dates against loan signing dates and disbursement schedules
# 3. Calculate wealth variance (property value vs. declared govt income)
# 4. Use in FOIA requests: "Declare all foreign assets for [PEP Name] during [Period]"
# 5. Report to: Dubai FIU, UK NCA, Swiss authorities (see contact directory)
# 6. Support SERAP and civil society asset recovery lawsuits
# 7. Demand Code of Conduct Bureau publish all asset declarations
# 8. Make this data public - Nigerians must see where their money went

### NEXT STEPS FOR ASSET RECOVERY:
# 1. File formal reports with Dubai Financial Intelligence Unit (goAML portal)
# 2. UK: Submit Suspicious Activity Reports to NCA (https://www.ukciu.gov.uk/sar-online)
# 3. Switzerland: Request Mutual Legal Assistance (irh@bj.admin.ch)
# 4. Freeze orders: Work with EFCC/SERAP to request international asset freezes
# 5. Repatriation: Follow Swiss-Nigeria asset return precedent (previous cases)
# 6. Prosecute: Use recovered assets as evidence in corruption trials
# 7. Publish: Full transparency on recovered amounts and destination of funds

### DATA GAPS (Require Further Investigation):
# 1. Swiss bank account details (protected by banking secrecy laws)
# 2. Beneficial ownership of shell companies (some jurisdictions still opaque)
# 3. Properties in other tax havens (Cayman, BVI, Panama)
# 4. Full list of UK properties (Land Registry requires individual searches)
# 5. US properties (some states have public records, others don't)
# 6. Family members' properties (children, spouses often used as proxies)
# 7. Recent purchases (2023-2024 data may not yet be in leaks)

### LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Use publicly available data only to avoid defamation claims
# - Cite sources meticulously
# - Focus on patterns and variance, not unproven accusations
# - Support civil society legal actions rather than individual allegations
# - Frame as "accountability demands" not "accusations"
# - Always provide PEPs opportunity to explain wealth sources (burden shifts to them under EFCC Act)
